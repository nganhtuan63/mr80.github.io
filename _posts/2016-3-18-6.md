This post is a summary of what I've learned about "modern" Javascript core concepts including Scope, Function, Closure, Async Function, Oject, and Module.

## Scope

In Javascript, every variable or function has a scope where it can be accessed or not. Let's learn scope through examples:

**Global scope**

```
var myPoint1 = 1;

function showPoint1() {
	console.log(myPoint); // display 1
}

showPoint2();
```

myPoint1 is declared as global scope so it can be accessed within any scope. In this example, it is called legally in the scope of showPoint1() function.

**Local scope **

```
function showPoint2() {
	var myPoint2 = 2;
}

console.log(myPoint2); // error
```
myPoint2 is declared within the scope of showPoint2() function. So, it cannot be accessed at global scope.

**Nested function scope**

In javascript, you can declare function in function (nested function). The inner function can access the variables of the outer function.
