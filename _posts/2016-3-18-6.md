This post is a summary of what I've learned about "modern" Javascript core concepts including Scope, Function, Closure, Async Function, Oject, and Module.

## Scope

In Javascript, every variable or function has a scope where it can be accessed or not. Let's learn scope through examples:

### Global scope

```
var myPoint1 = 1;

function showPoint1() {
	console.log(myPoint); // displays 1
}

showPoint2();
```

myPoint1 is declared as global scope so it can be accessed within any scope. In this example, it is called legally in the scope of showPoint1() function.

### Local scope

```
function showPoint2() {
	var myPoint2 = 2;
}

console.log(myPoint2); // error
```
myPoint2 is declared within the scope of showPoint2() function. So, it cannot be accessed at global scope.

### Nested function scope

In javascript, you can declare function in function - nested function (We will learn more about this at Function part). The inner function can access the variables of the outer function.

```
function outerFunction1(myPoint3) {
	function innerFunction1() {
		console.log(6+myPoint3);
	}
	innerFunction1();
}

outerFunction1(3); // displays 9
```

Can an outer function access the variables within the scope of inner function? Let's check:

```
function outerFunction2() {
	function innerFunction2() {
		var myPoint4 = 4;
	}
	console.log(myPoint4);
}

outerFunction2();
```

The answer is no. It will show error that myPoint4 is not defined.
