This post is a summary of what I've learned about "modern" Javascript core concepts including Scope, Function, Closure, Async Function, Oject, and Module.

## Scope and Closure

In Javascript, every variable or function has a scope where it can be accessed or not. Let's learn scope through examples:

### Global scope

```
var myPoint1 = 1;

function showPoint1() {
	console.log(myPoint); // displays 1
}

showPoint2();
```

myPoint1 is declared as global scope so it can be accessed within any scope. In this example, it is called legally in the scope of showPoint1() function.

### Local scope

```
function showPoint2() {
	var myPoint2 = 2;
}

console.log(myPoint2); // error
```
myPoint2 is declared within the scope of showPoint2() function. So, it cannot be accessed at global scope.

### Closure

Official definition of closure:

<i>Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. In other words, the function defined in the closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created.</i>

And this is my understanding of closure: **you can declare function in function - nested function (We will learn more about this at Function part). The inner function can access all the variables of the outer function**. Let's do an example:

```
function outerFunction1(myPoint3) {
	function innerFunction1() {
		console.log(6+myPoint3);
	}
	innerFunction1();
}

outerFunction1(3); // displays 9
```

In this example, **outerFunction1** is instantiated with parameter **3**. Then, the **outerFunction1** is instantiated and it also 'remembers/contains' the **myPoint3** parameter value of the **outerFunction1** (closure mechanism); that's why the **innerFunction1** can access **myPoint3** variable properly.

So, can an outer function access the variables within the scope of inner function? Let's check:

```
function outerFunction2() {
	function innerFunction2() {
		var myPoint4 = 4;
	}
	console.log(myPoint4);
}

outerFunction2();
```

The answer is **no**. It will show error that myPoint4 is not defined.

#### => The inner function can access variables of the outer function but not otherwise.

## Javascript Function

Offical definition:

<i>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object.</i>

### Define traditional function

Traditionally, you can define a function first and call it later.

```
function helloThere() {
	console.log('Hello');
}

helloThere(); // displays Hello
```

No problem, right?

### Function can be defined and assign to a variable

You can also define a function and assign it into a variable

```
var pet = function (type) {
	console.log('I am a '+type);
}

pet('dog'); // displays - I am a dog
```

### Function can also be declared in an object

### Function returns function

### Async Function
